# Interpolation  

Using different kinds of interpolation, I managed to draw a ghost, a bat, a teddy bear and a cat.  

For drawing the image, open octave and type:
F1 -> uses neville interpolation and draws a ghost
F2 -> uses linear spline interpolation and draws a bat
F3 -> uses natural cubic spline interpolation and draws a teddy bear
FB -> uses tension cubic spline interpolation and draws a cat
